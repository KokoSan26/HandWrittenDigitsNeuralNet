The MNIS dataset used in this small project consists of 60,000 training images
with labels and 10,000 examples with labels. It was created by

Yann LeCun, Courant Institue, NYU
Corinna Cortes, Google Labs, New York
Christopher J.C. Burges, Microsoft Research, Redmond

Yann LeCun's version of the dataset, the one used in this project, can be found here:

I do not own this dataset, nor did I contribute to it obviously. All the credit goes to the creators mentioned above.
I do not plan to earn money with it or use it in any comercial sense or form, this is very clearly only a private project to
get myselfe into the development machine learning.
